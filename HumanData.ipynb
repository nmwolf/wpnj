    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization of data can be a powerful way to understand subjects of study from a different point of view, eliciting patterns or areas of analysis that might not otherwise be detected through reading a source only.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a need for humanists to diversify the approaches that they use to map humanities data. The tendency to select points as a representation of a source is strong. But there are other ways to represent spatial relationships. We'll work with one in particular, line segments, which can be a powerful way to model itineraries, journeys, and other forms of movement across landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in this session we'll consider a new \"container\" for how we can hold data, JSON (and specifically, GeoJSON, a container for geographic data).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Materials**\n",
    "\n",
    " - A good text editor, Google Maps, and a [GeoJSON validator/viewer](http://geojson.io).\n",

    "### 2. Geocoding (aka Geolocating)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can visualize the itineraries contained in this tourist guide, we'll need to become proficient at finding geographic coordinates for the places mentioned in the source. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most mapping visualization systems rely on decimal-degree versions of Cartesian map coordinates -- in other words, the number of degrees from the equator (latitude) and number of degrees from the Prime Meridian (longitude), converted from degrees/minutes/seconds to a decimal number. Positive latitude or longitude indicate northern and easterly directions from 0 degrees, and negative indicate westerly and southern.\n",

    "1. Enter the street address or cross street description into https://maps.google.com.\n",

    "\n",
    "We now have everything we need to produce an interesting comparison of day and night itineraries as laid out in our 1904 sample guides. Let's divide into two groups, day group and night group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Introduce yourselves and say hello.\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. Make sure everyone understands what the task at hand is.\n",
    " \n",
    " 3. Each group will take one of two itineraries listed in the guide. Compiling a list of locations that can serve as segments of a full itinerary, our aim is to build a table of coordinates sketching out the travel described by the guide. Use the main (large) headers as locations, and only as many of the bold subheaders that are needed to make a complete and unbroken line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **day group** should work through the itinerary laid out in the chapter \"A Tour of the City\" that starts on page 82 and continues to page 125 (HT [link to the start of this page](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112089222134&view=1up&seq=92) here. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **night group** should work on the itinerary laid out in \"A Ramble at Night\" that starts on page 147 and continues to page 156 (HT [link to start page](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112089222134&view=1up&seq=157)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use your discretion on what inflection points you select -- we don't need to be hyper detailed, but we do want to produce a good itinerary.\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. Collectively compile the locations in your group's shared Google Sheet using Google Maps to locate the start and end point of each leg of the itinerary. Use the first column so that each group member can claim a row to be working on.\n",

    " 5. Decide as group on one \"variable\" to collect for each itinerary leg from the prose description and add it in Column E. For example, you might consider a categorical variable such as the type of city feature predominantly described. A variable that consists of \"monument,\" \"city administration,\" \"culinary\", etc., for example, referring to what type of features included in the itinerary, could lead to interesting questions about what \"uses\" were envisioned for certain neighborhoods in the city.\n",

    "### 4. Introduction to JSON and to GeoJSON\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a variety of options open to us as to how we can structure representations of our data so that the data can be written to a computer file for storage. For the most part, we seek forms that are easy to read for humans who view the characters that together make up a reprsentation of that data, and yet are highly structured (e.g. predictable) enough that a computer can interpret their contents consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, when working with tabular data, we work in terms of character-separated rows of records. CSVs, or comma-separated systems, are very common. \n",
    "\n",
    "But another useful system is called javascript objection notation, JSON, and it involves moving our tabular records/observations to a series (array) of repeated variable-value pairs. Think of this as repeatedly linking a row value to its column (variable) label. A drawback to this is that the resulting object contains a lot more characters (our column/variable names are repeated a lot), but among the advantages are that the order that we list out our \"cell values\" no longer matters -- every value is linked to its variable as well as to its accompanying values. It is also more extensible. Since the contents of any JSON value can itself be rendered in JSON, we can have a highly complex, multidimensional data structure described using a relatively minimal container.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a table like this (examples from NYU's [Arabic Collections Online](http://dlib.nyu.edu/aco/)):\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "    <tr><th>Year</th><th>Title</th><th>Holding Library</th></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>1962</td><td>al- Murshid ilá mawāṭin al-āthār wa-al-ḥaḍārah</td><td>NYU</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>1946</td><td>ʻAwdaẗ al-rūḥ</td><td>NYU</td></tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",

    "<pre>\n",

    "  {\"Year\":\"1962\",\n",
    "   \"Title\":\"al- Murshid ilá mawāṭin al-āthār wa-al-ḥaḍārah\",\n",
